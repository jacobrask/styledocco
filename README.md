StyleDocco generates documentation and style guide documents from your stylesheets.

Stylesheet comments will be parsed through [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and displayed in a generated HTML document. You can write code examples inside [GitHub Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) code fences (<code>```</code>) or prefixed with 4 spaces in your comments, and StyleDocco both renders the HTML and shows the code example.

The document is automatically split into new sections when it encounters a level 1 or 2 heading. Read more about the heading syntax in the [Markdown guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Only comments at the beginning of new lines are included, so to exclude something from the style guide, put some whitespace before the comment.

If your project includes a `README` file, it will be used as the base for an `index.html`. StyleDocco will also add some default styles to your documentation, but they are easy to modify to make it fit with your project.

StyleDocco will automatically compile any SASS, SCSS, Less or Stylus code before it is applied to the page.


## Installation

StyleDocco requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

`npm install -g styledocco`

or check out this repository.

 * `--overwrite`  Overwrite existing files (`docs.css`) in target directory.
 * `--pass`       Pass arguments through to the CSS precompiler *(optional)* (ex: `--pass="--include-path=../less/include"`)


## Examples

    /*
        <button class="btn primary">Primary</button>

    Provides extra visual weight and identifies the primary action in a set of buttons. */
    .btn.primary {
        background: blue;
        color: white;
    }

Would display the description, a button as well as the example HTML code. The CSS will be included in the `style` element of the document.

See the `examples` folder for more in-depth examples.


## Acknowledgements

A lot of the heavy lifting in StyleDocco is done by the excellent [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) module by Christopher Jeffrey. The original [Docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco) by Jeremy Ashkenas and [Docco Husky](https://github.com/mbrevoort/docco-husky) by Mike Brevoort were also of great help to this project. StyleDocco was also inspired by [Knyle Style Sheets](https://github.com/kneath/kss), a similar project written in Ruby.
